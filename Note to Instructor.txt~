All required features for the facebook default project were implemented in this project. From each page, the link to the logged in user's profile page is found in the upper right corner where it reads "Logged in as *username*", and the username links to the user's profile. The facebook header at the top of each page is a link to the newsfeed, as it is in real Facebook. At the bottom of the newsfeed, profile, search and the profile preferences pages, there are links that allow the user to navigate to the profile preferences and search for friends pages. From the profile preferences page, the edit link will allow the user to edit their personal information such as interests, quotes and their birthday.
